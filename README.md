antizionis-antidote
===================

My old VB code back in my college time. It was one of my antidote for malware, this malware infected my friend's PC and i made this antidote because of it. I didn't know what the name of the worm was. When i reverse engineered it i found "c:\antiZionisme.rm.exe" so i guessed the name was "antizionis"
